Fast, multithreaded, modular and extensible DHCP server written in Go

This is still a work-in-progress

## Example configuration

In CoreDHCP almost everything is implemented as a plugin. The order of plugins in the configuration matters: every request is evaluated calling each plugin in order, until one breaks the evaluation and responds to, or drops, the request.

The following configuration runs a DHCPv6-only server, listening on all the interfaces, using a custom DUID-LL as server ID, and reading the leases from a text file.

```
server6:
    listen: '[::]:547'
    plugins:
        - server_id: LL 00:de:ad:be:ef:00
        - file: "leases.txt"
        # - dns: 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 2001:4860:4860::8888 2001:4860:4860::8844

#server4:
#    listen: '0.0.0.0:67'
#    plugins:
        # - server_id: 10.10.10.1
        # - dns: 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
        # - router: 10.10.10.1
        # - netmask: 255.255.255.0
        # - range: leases.txt 10.10.10.100 10.10.10.200 60s
```

See also [config.yml.example](cmds/coredhcp/config.yml.example).

## Build and run

An example server is located under [cmds/coredhcp/](cmds/coredhcp/), so enter that
directory first. To build a server with a custom set of plugins, see the "Server
with custom plugins" section below.

Once you have a working configuration in `config.yml` (see [config.yml.example](cmds/coredhcp/config.yml.example)), you can build and run the server:
```
$ cd cmds/coredhcp
$ go build
$ sudo ./coredhcp

INFO[2019-01-05T22:28:07Z] Registering plugin "server_id"

INFO[2019-01-05T22:28:07Z] Found plugin: `file` with 1 args, `[leases.txt]`
INFO[2019-01-05T22:28:07Z] Loading plugins...

INFO[2019-01-05T22:28:07Z] plugins/server_id: using ll 00:de:ad:be:ef:00
INFO[2019-01-05T22:28:07Z] Loading plugin `file`
INFO[2019-01-05T22:28:07Z] plugins/file: reading leases from leases.txt
INFO[2019-01-05T22:28:07Z] plugins/file: loaded 1 leases from leases.txt
INFO[2019-01-05T22:28:07Z] Starting DHCPv6 listener on [::]:547

2019/01/05 22:28:07 Ready to handle requests
...
```

Then try it with the local test client, that is located under
[cmds/client/](cmds/client):
```
$ cd cmds/client
$ go build
$ sudo ./client
INFO[2019-01-05T22:29:21Z] &{ReadTimeout:3s WriteTimeout:3s LocalAddr:[::1]:546 RemoteAddr:[::1]:547}

    OptIANA{IAID=[250 206 176 12], t1=3600, t2=5400, options=[]}

```

# Plugins

CoreDHCP is heavily based on plugins: even the core functionalities are
implemented as plugins. Therefore, knowing how to write one is the key to add
new features to CoreDHCP.

Core plugins can be found under the [plugins](/plugins/) directory. Additional
plugins can also be found in the
[coredhcp/plugins](https://github.com/coredhcp/plugins) repository.

## Server with custom plugins

To build a server with a custom set of plugins you can use the
[coredhcp-generator](/cmds/coredhcp-generator/) tool. Head there for
documentation on how to use it.

# How to write a plugin

The best way to learn is to read the comments and source code of the
[example plugin](plugins/example/), which guides you through the implementation
of a simple plugin that prints a packet every time it is received by the server.
