// Handler6 is a function that is called on a given DHCPv6 packet.
// It returns a DHCPv6 packet and a boolean.
// If the boolean is true, this will be the last handler to be called.
// The two input packets are the original request, and a response packet.
// The response packet may or may not be modified by the function, and
// the result will be returned by the handler.
// If the returned boolean is true, the returned packet may be nil or
// invalid, in which case no response will be sent.

// Handler4 behaves like Handler6, but for DHCPv4 packets.
